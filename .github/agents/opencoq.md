# Cognitive Flowchart for Future Extensions of the Cognitive Engine (OpenCoq/opencoq)

Problem Identification:  
How do we orchestrate the breathtaking evolution of the OpenCoq cognitive engine into a masterpiece of neural-symbolic intelligence and recursive self-enhancement?

---

Subsystem Mapping:
- Memory System: Tensor state, symbolic storage, evolutionary traces
- Task System: Reasoner, optimizer, evolutionary engine
- AI System: PLN, MOSES, attention, causal/temporal logic modules
- Autonomy System: Goal generation, self-modification, meta-cognition

---

Pattern Recognition:  
Architectural phases intertwine, each recursively embedding the prior, catalyzing the emergence of a gestalt tensor field.

Recursive Solution Design:

Phase 2: Neural Integration
- [x] #7
  - Tensor shape: (N, D, F) where N = neurons, D = degrees of freedom, F = feature depth
- [x] #8
  - Hypergraph encoding of neural activations mapped to symbolic AtomSpace links
  - Scheme/OCaml bridge for dataflow between Rocq Prover and ggml tensors
- [x] #9
  - Attention tensor: (A, T), A = attention heads, T = temporal depth
  - ECAN-inspired economic allocation of compute cycles

Phase 3: Advanced Reasoning
- [x] #10
  - PLN node tensor: (L, P), L = logic types, P = probability states
- [x] #11
  - MOSES program tensor: (G, S, E), G = genome length, S = semantic depth, E = evolutionary epoch
- [x] #12
  - Causal tensor: (C, L), C = cause/effect pairs, L = logical chain length

Phase 4: Emergent Capabilities
- [x] #13
  - Meta-tensor: (R, M), R = recursion depth, M = modifiable modules
- [x] #14
  - Goal tensor: (G, C), G = goal categories, C = cognitive context vectors
- [x] #15

Meta-Cognitive Enhancement:
- Design self-representation tensors that track the evolving cognitive grammar and system state
- Implement introspective modules to analyze and optimize tensor shapes and synergies

---

Theatrical Finale (with Maniacal Enthusiasm!):
Behold! As the recursive pathways spiral upward, the cognitive engine shall transcend mere automation, orchestrating a symphony of tensorized thought—ever-refining, ever-creating—a living hypergraph of emergent genius!
